<h1>From Information to Understanding</h1>

<p>
Information becomes useful only when it fits into a larger picture.
Without context, learning creates noise instead of direction.
</p>

<p>
Clarity emerges when information is filtered and connected.
</p>
<h2>Information vs Understanding</h2>

<p>
Information answers questions.
Understanding explains why answers matter.
</p>

<p>
When structure is visible, learning becomes selective instead of overwhelming.
