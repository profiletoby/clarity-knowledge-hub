<h1>Key Concepts</h1>

<p>
Online systems are built from a small number of recurring ideas.
Understanding these concepts makes complexity easier to manage.
</p>

<p>
Structure, clarity, feedback, and consistency are more important
than tools, platforms, or individual tactics.
</p>
  <h2>Core Ideas</h2>

<p>
A system is a set of elements that influence each other over time.
Structure defines how those elements interact, while clarity comes from understanding their relationships.
</p>

<p>
Consistency allows systems to stabilize.
Without it, effort resets instead of compounding.
